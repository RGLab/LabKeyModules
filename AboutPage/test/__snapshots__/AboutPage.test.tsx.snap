        About ImmuneSpace
      </h2>
      <p>
        ImmuneSpace blossomed from a shared idea that generating large amounts collaborative data, cross-center and cross-assay, to characterize the status of the immune system in diverse populations under normal conditions and in response to various stimuli would be a beneficial platform. The Human Immunology Project Consortium (

        Since its release, ImmuneSpace has developed into powerful data management and analysis engine, where datasets can be easily explored and analyzed using state-of-the-art computational tools. ImmuneSpace takes advantage of the considerable infrastructure already developed through another HIPC platform,

          ImmPort
        </a>
        , which serves as a repository of data generated by investigators funded by DAIT. Data are submitted by each HIPC center to ImmPort using a set of standardized data templates. Once ImmPort has made these data public through routine data releases, the data are transferred to ImmuneSpace where integrative modeling across various data types and HIPC centers are enabled.

        ImmuneSpace provides multiple ways to interact with, visualize, and analyze data. Each study contains tabs to view raw data, run common analyses, and look at custom reports. All the analyses make use of the R statistical language, leveraging
