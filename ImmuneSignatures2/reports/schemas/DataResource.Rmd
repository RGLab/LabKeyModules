Vaccines are among the most cost-effective public health interventions for preventing 
morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. Combining traditional immunology 
with modern 'omic techniques and computational modeling will prompt rapid and 
transformative advances in vaccinology and vaccine discovery. Systems vaccinology allows 
integration of different 'omic platforms offering system-wide immune response measurements 
with computational approaches accelerating the identification of molecular signatures. 
The Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) generated and described molecular signatures 
that correlate with predicted immunogenicity and outcomes of vaccinations. While multiple 
publications from HIPC have identified these signatures, there is no formal framework to 
standardize these methods, thus impeding further comparative analysis across a wide range 
of infections and vaccinations studied. We hereby present the Immune Signatures dataset, a 
compendium of standardized systems vaccinology datasets to allow comparative analysis 
predicting the response across multiple vaccine types and pathogens.
