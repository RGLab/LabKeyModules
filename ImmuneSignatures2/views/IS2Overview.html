    <span class="bold-text">Brief description:</span>
    <span>The HIPC Immune Signatures Data Resource provides integrated host response data
    from human vaccination studies involving multiple vaccines. Pre-vaccination and
    temporal response profiles are analyzed to identify unique and common signatures,
    including those associated with differential antibody responses.

                        A central goal of the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC)
                        is the identification of molecular “signatures” that correlate
                        with the outcomes of vaccinations, adjuvants or natural
                        infections in humans. These signatures result from the computational
                        analysis of large-scale experimental data from high-throughput
                        systems biology approaches coupled with detailed clinical
                        phenotyping in well-characterized human cohorts.

                <p>
                        As part of the highly collaborative HIPC-II “Signatures Project,”
                        we have created the Immune Signatures Data Resource, a compendium
                        of standardized systems vaccinology datasets. This data resource
                        includes code to reproduce the processing and batch normalization
                        starting from the underlying study data in ImmPort and the Gene
                        Expression Omnibus (GEO). In addition, we provide codes to analyze
                        these data to identify unique and common signatures, including
                        those associated with differential antibody responses.
